## v0.2.2 - 2024-06-23

### Fixed

- Suggest keeping `spec/**/*` in the `exclude` section of `.solargraph.yml` to avoid performance issues (see [commit](https://github.com/lekemula/solargraph-rspec/commit/3f0fc39e59e99bf9430e55c52ecb88650e49315e))
- Fix `let` definitions when do/end keywords overlap with body definition
  ```ruby
    let(:todo) do # "do" keyword overlap
